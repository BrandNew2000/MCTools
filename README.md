# MCTools

MC Tools is a C++ based utility which allows the easy deployment and configuration of Minecraft servers. 
On first execution downloads PaperMC's paperclip jar and prompts the user to agree to the minecraft EULA and automatically generates eula.txt.
Additionally it asks the user for the seed, gamemode and also whether or not to activate the whitelist.

As of now it only works on windows.
